I've heard this referred to as a "flying tarball"

First, on the receiving machine, as root
cd to the directory you want to copy files into
run this command and it will wait for the sending servers
'nc -l 7000 | tar -xavf -'
  - netcat, listen on port 7000 (tcp), then pipe to tar with extract(x) archive(a) verbose(v) file(f). [The file is -]
  - archive flag keeps the permissions and ownership on the files. This can be used in your root directory (/) if you want to clone a server

** recieve with gzip - this is identical with the addition of the gunzip(z) flag, it will use more cpu and less bandwidth
'nc -l 7000 | tar -xazvf -'

Now, logon to the sending machine, as root
cd to the directory you want to copy from
'tar -cavf - * | nc otherhost 7000'
  - tar up the files in the current dirctory with these flags to create(c) archive(a) verbose(v) file(f) [the file is -]
  - archive flag keeps the permissions and ownership.
  - command is piped to netcat which sends it to the otherhost on port 7000 (tcp)
        or, with gzip
# tar -cazvf - * | nc otherhost 7000 


Other examples
        copy the directory above the one you're in
# tar -cazvf - dir | nc otherhost 7000

        skip mounts inside folder
tar -cazvf - * --one-file-system <filesystem> |nc nunifiaia400 7000
