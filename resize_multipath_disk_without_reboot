These are directions to resize a multipath disk on a RH system. This does not require a reboot.
part of this is cribbed from Brian Pitts, https://www.polibyte.com/2011/01/26/online-resizing-with-multipath-and-lvm/


Find the correct device

pvs

    Look for the volume group device in the PV column

 

This is a partition on the disk you want to work with, run lsblk and grep for the part after /dev/mapper with a flag -B3

lsblk | grep -B3 <device>

 

Look for the disk above the partition

multipath -l <disk>

 

Look for the devices above:

echo 1 > /sys/block/sdx/device/rescan

echo 1 > /sys/block/sdx/device/rescan

echo 1 > /sys/block/sdx/device/rescan

echo 1 > /sys/block/sdx/device/rescan

Resize the multipath device

multipathd resize map disk

    You should see “ok”

Resize the partition on the device

There are two parts to this. Performing the resize, and getting the device mapper to realize that the partition has been resized.

To perform the resize, use parted.

parted

Parted> select /dev/mapper/disk

Parted> p

Parted> resizepart 1 429GB
 - get new size from listing after p (print)

Parted> q

Resize the LVM physical volume

pvresize /dev/dm-6

Resize the LVM logical volume

I used vgdisplay vg-esan1 to see how much space was available. It’s a good idea to keep some in reserve for snapshots or emergencies.

lvextend -L +240G -r /dev/vgoracle/FS_oracle
